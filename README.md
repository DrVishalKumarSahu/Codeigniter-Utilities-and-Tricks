# Sanitizing-Input-in-Codeigniter
Basic class for sanitizing input in codeigniter using PHP 5.6+ built in functions

The Sanitize_input class basically contains handy methods for validating and filtering input. Coded for using in Codeigniter framework. It validates and filters data based on defined callback function. If fails returns "null" for now.


Expecting to add some tutorial and example soon. 

Anyone can use and modify the code at his/her own risk. It is basic idea for validation. Although CI provide filtering facility builtin.
